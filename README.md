# Cost of losing human capital due to sexual crime  <a class = "tocSkip">
----

**This repository** contains my research pursuing calcuating the social cost of losing victims of sexual crime.

One of my classmate killed herself in 2019. According to her friends, she had suffered from depression affected by sexual crime occured in 2017 and its litigation process which was definitely too painful for 22 years old young person to stand for. I heard of that the criminal sentenced by 2 years' imprisonment.

Not only that, I have witnessed that several sexual offenses are ignored in schools and it was usually because the assailants are too young to have records of crime. As a result, our society bore many sexual criminals who lost the sense of guilty and many victims who had no choice but to fight for it for themselves or to hide with the burden of shame.

There is a necessity to investigate that human capital lost due to the crimes and the sentences imposed to the assailants have been treated well from the perspective of economics. That is, I expect to study with a cross section data whether the law suits have sentenced a penalty as much as loss of society. Also, with time series data, I would like to investigate existing law and the court's rulling work effectively as a warning for potential crimes.
